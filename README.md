Monte Carlo Photon Propagation Simulation

Welcome to the Monte Carlo algorithm in MATLAB designed for simulating photon propagation in tissue with 0.2 x 0.2 x 0.2 cm dimensions. By running this code, you can generate a dynamic fluence visualization that provides insights into photon behavior at varying tissue depths. An example of the visualization can be found in the included 'sample.gif' file within this repository.

Overview
